# Don't take this seriously

Yes, f`*`n p`*`lice... it's called entertainment.

I'm trying to make an AI program that has full code execution and it uses its powers to read through code for you, in chunks, and find possible vulnerabilities. Once an exact vuln is found, it will write up a PoC for you and store it so you can read it (and prolly laugh). The AI talks to itself to converse in the conversation. This will be made with AI.

The prompt I'm using:

> lets make a fun project in nodejs. this will be an AI language model running through Ollama and it... speaks to itself. this program will be used to hunt bugs automatically through an LLM. it will have full code execution, as well as custom commands it can run to do things like say, read chunks of a file so it doesnt digest an entire huge file in one, genertating a file tree, ect that would let this AI hunt bugs. once a vulnerability in the code is found, the AI should create a markdown document highlighting the exact vulnerability in the code, a writeup, and a PoC. this hsould start with analysing the flashrom code. if it can't do that, it will go onto a different project after housekeeping. to make sure the AI can acctually converse well and bug hunt good, it should be able to talk to itself through message history... maybe use tinyllama to read? or mistral. Use the Ollama JavaScript Library.

> I want the FULL project.

Right now it has given me broken code but I'm confident it will look in soon.
